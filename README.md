Tiny-Virtual-Machine
====================

A small virtual machine that runs custom bytecode.

Still being heavily worked on. For fun.

Current features:
- LOAD, STORE, ADD, SUB and HALT commands
- source file parsing and conversion into bytecode
- error handling during both execution and parsing (needs more work)

To do:
- find a way to handle endianess
- more commands
- pointers
- procedures
